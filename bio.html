      My movement journey began with dance, the first language through which I connected with my body. From a young age, I was captivated by rhythm, coordination, and the ability to communicate through movement. Dance gave me more than just physical skills—it cultivated a deep awareness of space, timing, and emotion. It was through dance that I first experienced the body not just as a vehicle for action, but as a medium for expression and storytelling.

As I grew, my natural curiosity and desire to explore new challenges led me to a range of sports. I immersed myself in basketball, martial arts, and tennis, each offering a new lens through which to understand movement. Basketball sharpened my responsiveness and spatial awareness, martial arts introduced me to discipline and internal power, while tennis became my main focus and eventually my profession. Competing at a high level in tennis taught me invaluable lessons about precision, performance under pressure, and the biomechanics of efficiency and endurance. It was a period of intense growth—mentally, physically, and emotionally.

After my professional tennis career, I felt called to rediscover the playfulness and creativity that first drew me to movement. I returned to martial arts with a new perspective and began exploring acrobatics, which introduced an entirely new level of body control, fear management, and improvisation. This phase reawakened a sense of freedom and exploration that I had missed in the rigid structure of competitive sports.

It was around this time that I encountered the Ido Portal Method—a comprehensive and ever-evolving approach to movement that immediately resonated with me. Ido’s philosophy emphasized adaptability, curiosity, and the reclaiming of physical freedom through continuous exploration. It validated what I had experienced throughout my journey: that movement is not just exercise, but a way of life. A process of learning, unlearning, and rediscovering what it means to be fully embodied.

Today, I bring together all of these experiences—dance, sports, martial arts, acrobatics, and movement philosophy—into my own training approach. My system is not about specialization or quick fixes; it’s about helping people reconnect with their bodies, expand their movement vocabulary, and build a sustainable relationship with physical practice. Whether you're an athlete, artist, or someone simply curious about your own potential, I aim to guide others toward greater awareness, freedom, and joy through movement. This is more than training—it’s a lifelong journey of transformation, exploration, and evolution.
